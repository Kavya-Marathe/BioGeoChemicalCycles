        <h1><u>Bio-Geo Chemical cycles</u></h1>
           <p>
             <b>“Biogeochemical cycles mainly refer to the movement of nutrients and other elements between biotic and abiotic factors.”</b>
            The term biogeochemical is derived from “bio” meaning biosphere, “geo” meaning the geological components and “chemical” meaning the elements that move through a    cycle.
             The matter on Earth is conserved and present in the form of atoms. Since matter can neither be created nor destroyed, it is recycled in the earth’s system in         various forms.
             The earth obtains energy from the sun which is radiated back as heat, rest all other elements are present in a closed system. The major elements include:<br>
            
           <ul><li>Carbon</li>
           <li>Hydrogen</li> 
           <li>Nitrogen</li> 
           <li>Oxygen</li>
           <li>Phosphorus</li>
           <li>Sulphur</li> </ul>
            These elements are recycled through the biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem. The atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere are the abiotic components of the            ecosystem.Energy flows through an ecosystem and is dissipated as heat, but chemical elements are recycled.The ways in which an element—or compound such as water—moves             between its various living and nonliving forms and locations in the biosphere is called a biogeochemical cycle.Biogeochemical cycles important to living organisms              include the water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles.

           Water, which contains hydrogen and oxygen, is essential for living organisms. That places the water cycle pretty high on the list of cycles we care about!
          The hydrosphere—the set of places where water can be found as it cycles on Earth—is large and diverse. Water is present as a liquid on the Earth's surface and                  underneath the ground, as ice in the polar ice caps and glaciers, and as water vapor in the atmosphere. For more information about how water cycles among these forms, .
        <li>Water makes up more than half of our bodies, but humans cannot live by water alone. Instead, there are some other key elements that keep our bodies running and are            part of biogeochemical cycles.</li>
        <li>Carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is also a key component of fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Nitrogen is needed for our  DNA ,RNA  and proteins and is critical to human agriculture.</li>
        <li>Phosphorus is a key component of DNA and RNA and is one of the main ingredients—along with nitrogen—in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture.</li>
        <li>Sulfur is key to protein structure and is released to the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.</li>
        These cycles don't happen in isolation, and the water cycle is a particularly important driver of other biogeochemical cycles. For example, the movement of water is critical    for the leaching of nitrogen and phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. The ocean is also a major reservoir—holding tank—for carbon.
         Though each element or compound takes its own route, all of these key chemical nutrients cycle through the biosphere, moving between the biotic—living—and abiotic—nonliving—     worlds and from one living organism to another.

  <h3><u>Types of Bio-Geo Chemical cycles</u></h3>
  <p>
 Biogeochemical cycles are basically divided into two types:<br>
    
<u>Gaseous cycles</u>  – Includes Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and the Water cycle.
<u>Sedimentary cycles</u> – Includes Sulphur, Phosphorus, Rock cycle, etc.
Let us have a look at each of these biogeochemical cycles in brief:

<h4><u>Water Cycle</u></h4>
The water from the different water bodies evaporates, cools, condenses and falls back to the earth as rain.
This biogeochemical cycle is responsible for maintaining weather conditions. The water in its various forms interacts with the surroundings and changes the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere.
There’s another process called Evapotranspiration (i.e. vapour produced from leaves) which aids this process. It is the evaporation of water from the leaves, soil and water bodies to the atmosphere which again condenses and falls as rain.

<h4><u>Carbon Cycle</u></h4>
It is one of the biogeochemical cycles in which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and pedosphere.
All green plants use carbon dioxide and sunlight for photosynthesis. Carbon is thus stored in the plant. The green plants, when dead, are buried into the soil that gets converted into fossil fuels made from carbon. These fossil fuels when burnt, release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Also, the animals that consume plants, obtain the carbon stored in the plants. This carbon is returned to the atmosphere when these animals decompose after death. The carbon also returns to the environment through cellular respiration by animals.
Huge carbon content in the form of carbon dioxide is produced that is stored in the form of fossil fuel (coal & oil) and can be extracted for various commercial and non-commercial purposes. When factories use these fuels, the carbon is again released back in the atmosphere during combustion.

<h4><u>Nitrogen Cycle</u></h4>
It is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into several forms and it gets circulated through the atmosphere and various ecosystems such as terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
Nitrogen is an essential element of life. The nitrogen in the atmosphere is fixed by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria present in the root nodules of the leguminous plants and made available to the soil and plants.
The bacteria present in the roots of the plants convert this nitrogen gas into a usable compound called ammonia. 
Ammonia is also supplied to plants in the form of fertilizers. This ammonia is converted into nitrites and nitrates. 
The denitrifying bacteria reduce the nitrates into nitrogen and return it into the atmosphere.

<h4><u>Oxygen Cycle</u></h4>
This biogeochemical cycle moves through the atmosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere. Oxygen is an abundant element on our Earth. It is found in the elemental form in the atmosphere to the extent of 21%.
Oxygen is released by the plants during photosynthesis. Humans and other animals inhale the oxygen exhale carbon dioxide which is again taken up by the plants. 
They utilise this carbon dioxide in photosynthesis to produce oxygen, and the cycle continues.

 <h4><u>Phosphorous Cycle</u></h4>
In this biogeochemical cycle, phosphorus moves through the hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere. 
Phosphorus is extracted by the weathering of rocks. Due to rains and erosion phosphorus is washed away in the soil and water bodies.
 Plants and animals obtain this phosphorus through the soil and water and grow. Microorganisms also require phosphorus for their growth.
   When the plants and animals die they decompose, and the stored phosphorus is returned to the soil and water bodies which is again consumed by plants and animals and the cycle continues.

  <h4><u>Sulphur Cycle</u></h4>
This biogeochemical cycle moves through the rocks, water bodies and living systems. Sulphur is released into the atmosphere by the weathering of rocks and is converted into sulphates. These sulphates are taken up by the microorganisms and plants and converted into organic forms. Organic sulphur is consumed by animals through food. When the animals die and decompose, sulphur is returned to the soil which is again obtained by the plants and microbes, and the cycle continues.

  <h4><u>Rock Cycle</u></h4>
  The rock cycle is a basic concept in geology that describes transitions through geologic time among the three main rock types: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous. Each rock type is altered when it is forced out of its equilibrium conditions. For example, an igneous rock such as basalt may break down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain in equilibrium and change as they encounter new environments.

  <h3><u>Importance of these cycles</u></h3>
  <p>
  <li>Biogeochemical cycles help explain how the planet conserves matter and uses energy.</li>
    <li>The cycles move elements through ecosystems, so the transformation of things can happen.</li>
    <li> They are also important because they store elements and recycle them.</li>
     <li>Biogeochemical cycles help in the regulation of natural elements that are necessary for living beings, by channelling through physical and biological phenomenon.</li>
   <li>It acts as a recycling procedure in nature.Biogeochemical cycles are critical to the existence of life, transforming energy and matter into usable forms to support the functioning of ecosystems,Moreover, biogeochemical cycles can show you the connection among all living and nonliving things on Earth.</li>
   <li>Understanding these cycles is crucial because people affect them. Human activity is disturbing some of these natural cycles and hurting different ecosystems.</li>
   <li>By paying attention to how these pathways work, humans may be able to stop the harmful impact.</li>
